        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
          <li>Declarations, found at the top of the code, tell the browser what doc type it should expect when opened. Declarations are not case-sensitive but HTML elements are.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element, for example, lang="en" tells the browser the webpage is in English. HTML attributes are ALWAYS defined in the beginning element.</li>
          <br> 
          <li>Important metadata tags inside the head element include:</li>
          <li>title: a required element, extremely important for SEO.</li>
          <li>style: defines the CSS styles associated with the website.</li>
          <li>base: defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>link: connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>meta: defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>script: embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>NOTE: Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. All elements inside the body element are the child elements and the body element is the parent element.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements: the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. Makes HTML easier to read by other devs and the browser. The body element is an example of this.</li>
          <li>For visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag (with angle brackets) and a closing tag (with a forward slash after the first bracket).</li>
          <li>Headings organize a page with titles and subtitles and are represented by h1, h2, h3, etc.</li>
          <li>A block of text or paragraph is represented by the p element.</li>
          <li>ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains info about images and can contain many attributes such as src, which defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line break between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The anchor element, represented by the letter "a", creates links to the same webpage or to other ones. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The footer element usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation. It appears at the bottom of the page.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): a programming language used by devs to define how webpage content is presented to users. This includes colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <br>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS:
        <br>
            1. Inline CSS: Used when you want to style an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Useful for quick + permanent changes but less flexible than the other style sheets because they must be edited individually.
            <br>
            2. Internal style sheet: Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of HTML. The rules only apply to that page. CSS classes and IDs can be used to style multiple elements in the page code. To embed an entire stylesheet in the HTML file, we use a 'style' element in the head element.
            <br>
            3. External style sheet: The most common way to style a webpage. Allows devs to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file. We link a file with an external sheet with a 'link' element placed in the HTML head element.
          </li> <br>
          <li>Separation of concerns: refers to separating code into different files based on use, as is the case with the external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to  which the rules/declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations have two important components: property and value. (ex. in 'color: blue;' color is the property and blue is the value.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <br>
          <li>CSS box model: Every HTML element is a box; each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The * symbol applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages devs to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. For instance, we can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, and declarations will affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>Within a link element, a 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked doc resource.</li>
          <li>Within a link element, the 'href' attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>A class selector is preceded by a period like this: .card </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each verison of your project. It is accessed through the command line.</li>
          <li>Git is used to track our versions locally whereas GitHub allows us to store projects in repos remotely and collaborate with others.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git add [file]: add a file as it looks now to your next commit.</li>
          <li>git add -A: add all changes from the current working branch.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message"</li>
          <li>git checkout main: navigate to the main branch.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls in the base(main) branch to the feature branch. Checks if our local branch is in sync with base branch in GitHub.</li>
          <li>git push origin [file]: pushes changes to the remote repository.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>remember: to create a file, switch to the directory you wish to save it and input: touch [file name]</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Variable: a named container that allows us to store data in our code. To declare a variable in JS we use the 'var' keyword and then give it a name. Then we use = to assign the data we want stored in it. ex: var shape = "circle";</li>
          <li>A string that includes multiple topics should have quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Each line of JS code ends with ;</li>
          <li>console.log method: use it to output a message to the web console by adding an argument inside parentheses. ex: console.log(topics);</li>
          <li>JS files are linked within the body element of an HTML file.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Control flow: the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JS, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page to the last at the bottom.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed.</li>
          <li>When using the 'if' statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true. To provide more conditions we use 'else if'.</li>
          <li>Truthy vs. falsy</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator === checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result 'true' if the value are equal and 'false' if they are not.</li>
          <li>We can store an array (a group of related data) in a variable and use a 'for' loop to perform a task on each piece of the data, using a few lines of code.</li>
          <li>Index: a unique number that identifies the location of a data item in an array. In JS, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Another statement must be used to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop contains the following 3 statements:
            <br> 1. Starting point of the loop. var x = 0;
            <br> 2. Condition. As long as the # in var x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. (Length is a built-in array property). x < shapes.length;
            <br> 3. x++ (We know the # increases by 1 each time. This is a shortcut way of writing x+1).
          </li>
          <li>This loop starts with a 'for': for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) { //code block}</li>
          <br>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, in case you need it later. To do so, put /* and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tell the computer how to perform a task. Unlike loops, they don't automatically execute when JS file is run.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses. function RandomName () {//code block} </li>
          <li>To call a function, we use its name in the JS file where we want the code to execute.</li>
        </ul>
