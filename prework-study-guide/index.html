        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
          <li>Declarations, found at the top of the code, tell the browser what doc type it should expect when opened. Declarations are not case-sensitive but HTML elements are.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element, for example, lang="en" tells the browser the webpage is in English. HTML attributes are ALWAYS defined in the beginning element.</li>
          <br> 
          <li>Important metadata tags inside the head element include:</li>
          <li>title: a required element, extremely important for SEO.</li>
          <li>style: defines the CSS styles associated with the website.</li>
          <li>base: defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>link: connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>meta: defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>script: embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>NOTE: Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. All elements inside the body element are the child elements and the body element is the parent element.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements: the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. Makes HTML easier to read by other devs and the browser. The body element is an example of this.</li>
          <li>For visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag (with angle brackets) and a closing tag (with a forward slash after the first bracket).</li>
          <li>Headings organize a page with titles and subtitles and are represented by h1, h2, h3, etc.</li>
          <li>A block of text or paragraph is represented by the p element.</li>
          <li>ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains info about images and can contain many attributes such as src, which defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line break between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The anchor element, represented by the letter "a", creates links to the same webpage or to other ones. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The footer element usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation. It appears at the bottom of the page.</li>
